  <p style="margin-left:50px; font-size:25px ;">Panchkula is a well planned city in the Panchkula district, Haryana. It forms a part of the tri- city area i.e.
     Panchkula, Chandigarh and Mohali. The city hosts the Chandimandir Cantonment which is the headquarters of the Western Command of the Indian Army.<br>
     The city is well designed with systematic layout, wide roads adorned with beautiful tress and buildings that compliment the modern outlook of the planning.<br>
     The district of Panchkula is also famous for its natural beauty as it enjoys thickest forest cover in the entire State of Haryana. Besides Panchkula city, the district has five towns, Pinjore, Kalka, Barwala, Morni and Ranipur Rani.<br>
     Morni Hills, a much sought after tourist destination, is the only hill station in Haryana. It is located on the offshoots of Shivalik Range of the Himalayas and is known for many picturesque spots for sight-seeing. <br><br>
     The origin of the name Panchkula came from the place where five irrigation canals meet. Panch is five and Kuls means canal, hence the name Panchkula. The canals take water from the Ghaggar and distribute it from Nada Sahib to Mansa Devi
     . The canals, build by a ruler in the past are a good example of ancient engineering acumen, as at some spots the water is raised to higher levels than the river course.</p><br>
