   <p style="margin-left:50px; font-size:25px ;">The district derives its name from its headquarter town Rohtak, which is said to be a correction of Rohtashgarh, a name still applied to the ruined sites (also called khokhrakot) of two older sites, one lying immediately north of the present town and other about 5 kms. towards the east.
     Traditionally, it was named after Raja Rohtash, during whose reign, the city is said to have been built. It is also claimed that the town derives its name from the Roherra (Tacoma Undulate) tree called Rohitaka in Sanskrit. It is said that before the town came into existence, it was the site of a forest of Rohitaka trees and hence its name became Rohtak.
      Another version connects Rohtak with Rohitaka, which is mentioned in Mahabharta and bears a connection with the campaign of Nakula, the Pandva warrior.</p>
      <h2 style="margin-left:50px; font-size:25px ;">History of the district as an administrative unit    </h2>
      <p style="margin-left:50px; font-size:25px ;">The areas of Rohtak district under went many changes, extending over hundreds of years before the administrative unit emerged in its present form. Under the Mughal Emperor Akbar,
         when his Minister Todar Mal divided North India into administrative circles, the areas of Rohtak (as a part of Suba of Delhi) fell within the Sarkars of Delhi and Hisar firuqa. Lying close to the imperial city of Delhi, 
         the tract which now comprises the Rohtak district, was often granted in military jagir by the Sultan and Mughal emperors to the nobles of the court. For this reason, Rajput, Brahman, Afghan and Baluch chiefs have at different times enjoyed its revenues. </p><br>
         <p style="margin-left:50px; font-size:25px ;">After the death of Bahadur-Shah-I (1707-12), the successor of Aurangzeb, the Mughal empire began to decline rapidly. The areas of Rohtak frequently experienced achange of masters. The claims of imperials were contested sometimes by the Rajputs, Jats & Sikhs and often by the Marathas. George Thomas, the protege of a Maratha leader, Appa Kandirao, established his authority at Hansi and extended it to Meham and Rohtak for a number of years, until Maratha chieftain Sindhia and various other regional forces combined to drive him away. Sindhia was, however, not destined to hold for long his conquests to the west of the Yamuna. After a treaty signed on December-30, 1803,
             the Rohtak area alongwith the other possessions of Sindhia situtated to the west of Yamuna were passed to the British and these came under the administration of the North-West provinces.</p>
