   <p style="margin-left:50px; font-size:25px ;">Jind is a city which is known as the heart of Haryana. It is one of the oldest districts of Haryana and holds historical and mythological importance.
     It is believed that here a Jayanti Devi Temple was built in honour of Jayanti Devi (The Goddess of Victory) by Pandavas. Slowly the town was developed around the temple hence the name Jaitapuri turned Jind. 
     Another legend is that the Sikh Maharaja Ranjeet Singh named this city after on the name of his youngest queen "Maharani Jind kaur" as this city was under the erstwhile Patiala Riyasat.<br>
     The excavations of archaeology indicate that this city was ruined for five times but every time it prospered again with full spirit. The archaeological findings also link to the presence of pre-Harappan era at this place.
      It is said that Lord Rama passed from this city at the time of Sita’s 'swayamwara' to break the Shiva’s bow.<br>
      Interestingly, Jind was also one of the first Sikh kingdoms. Raja Gajpat Singh, a great grandson of Phul, who founded the Phulkian Misl, established an independent Sikh kingdom by conquering a large tract of country which included the 
      territory occupied by the present district of Jind from the Afghan invader and governor Zain Khan in 1763 and made Jind city, the capital of the state in 1776. He made a fort here in 1775.
